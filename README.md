## A simulated annealing algorithm for randomizing weighted networks

This repository contains code written in support of the work presented in 
[A simulated annealing algorithm for randomizing weighted networks](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.02.23.581792v1), 
as well as data necessary to reproduce the results.

We propose a simulated annealing procedure for generating strength sequence-preserving randomized networks and benchmark it against other rewiring algorithms commonly used in network neuroscience.

Each of the main directories of this repository are documented with a README file, so feel free to check them out for more details.
